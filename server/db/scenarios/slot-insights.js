// Replaces briefing.aiInsights with a set of template+slots insights that
// exercise every branch of the frontend insight-resolver without requiring
// a real Claude API call. Useful for verifying:
//   - "tonight", "tomorrow", "this morning" rendering
//   - "last night" / "yesterday" back-references
//   - weekday rendering for >= 2 days out
//   - distant (> 6 days) absolute-date rendering
//   - new-slot minting (the kind Claude would produce for derived dates)
//   - back-compat insights (icon + text, no template) rendering unchanged
//
// Usage: ?mock=1&scenario=slot-insights
